# PolyMod Basic

This will be a simplified version of the main PolyMod synth (see other repos on my account), with Teensy code and a breadboard layout. It exists because I am writing a magazine tutorial on how to build a digital synth from scratch. I will link to the magazine article if/when it gets published. Still a work in progress right now.
